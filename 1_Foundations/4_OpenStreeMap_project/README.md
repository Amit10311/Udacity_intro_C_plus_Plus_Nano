 Nodes, ways, and relations are some of the fundamental building blocks of OSM data files. 

 * Nodes : Each node indicates a single point with an identifier id, latitude lat, and longitude lon.
 * Ways : An ordered list of nodes : feature could be a road, or a boundary of a park, or some other feature in the map.
 * Relation : data structure which documents a relationship between other data elements
